 This is the third version of a book about writing applications with Xamarin.Forms, the exciting mobile development platform for iOS, Android, and Windows unveiled by Xamarin in May 2014. \(The first two versions of this book were Preview Editions.\) Xamarin.Forms lets you write shared user-interface code in C\# and XAML \(the Extensible Application Markup Language\) that maps to native controls on these platforms. The Windows support of Xamarin.Forms includes the Windows Runtime \(WinRT\) for targeting Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 devices, and the Universal Windows Platform \(UWP\), which is a form of the Windows Runtime that targets Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile devices with a single program. The two previous versions of this book were called Preview Editions because they were not complete. At 1200 pages, this is the first edition that can claim to be complete, even though several topics are not included and Xamarin.Forms continues to be progressively enhanced with no sign of slowing down.
